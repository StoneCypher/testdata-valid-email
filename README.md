testdata-valid-emails
=====================

A list of valid, frequently ugly email addresses for use in automated testing



What's this about?
------------------

This is just an array of valid email addresses in notations many people aren't
aware of.  The primary intent of this list is for use in automated testing.

This list begins by consuming
[this other excellent list](https://fightingforalostcause.net/content/misc/2006/compare-email-regex.php).
The intent is to augment it with the larger TLD list soon, as well as punycode equivalents.




Polemic :neckbeard:
